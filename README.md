# MonsterHunterRiseSetsBuilder
A beta app that helps monster hunter rise players build their armor sets based on the skills they like.
There still quite a few bugs I am currently working on fixing but generally it works so far.
It can be used as good starting point for creating your sets. You can then change them to your liking with a few tweeks.
Especially useful if your build is not one of the most mainstream ones out there.
Simply run the app_ui.py file from the project directory.
Code is a bit messy as I was building this on the fly without much designing in the beginning.
Using 2 json files as source databases.

Added a new set builder where the users can manually add the armor parts of their choice and get a preview of their build
